This pattern is been created to provide a way to automatically upload Cucumber(BDD) Test Cases and Test Results from GitHub to Azure DevOps TestPlans.  This is to reduce efforts involved in manually updating Azure DevOps.
- This workflow triggers only if there is a change made in Feature Files (addition of new files/updates made to existing files)
- Creates test cases in Azure DevOps from specified path of Feature Files (if not already present)
- Updates test cases in Azure DevOps from specified path of Feature Files (if already)
- Test Cases already found will not be created again
- If triggered branch is other than "main" then the updated Feature Files with ADO Test Case ID Tag Number will be commited back in same branch.
- Its recommened you enter user story number as Tag for each scenario in feature files in format @story:XXXX. If you do this we create link between user story and test cases automatically!
- If you would like to upload a attachment for each test cases. for example if you want to upload json request and expected json response for a test case. you can add tag attchment: TC1_request.json attchment: TC1_expected_response.json
- It would be lot easier if you add each tag in a seperate line so its clean to understand.
- First you need to create Test Plan and a Test Suite.
- If you create test cases for testing a bug fix, then add Tag in format @bug:XXXX. This will link your test cases with respective bug fix id.
- If triggered branch is "main" then the updated Feature Files with ADO Test Case ID Tag Number(@TC:XXXX) will be commited in a new branch called "cucumber-ado-sync". you need to delete branch cucumber-ado-sync after doing merge.
- We suggest you to review the commit updated feature files (with ADO Test Case ID Tag Number) to main branch. Alternatively you can automate PR creation merge as well.
